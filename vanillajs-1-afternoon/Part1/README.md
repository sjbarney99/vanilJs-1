# Tic Tac Toe Board

# Project Summary

In this project, we will practice vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation by creating a Tic Tac Toe game.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we will create a Javascript file and connect it to our HTML file.

### Instructions

- Create a file called `index.js`.
- Connect that script file to the HTML page.
  - Feel free to console.log a message to test the connect from your script file.


### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> /index.html </code> </summary>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Tic Tac Toe</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav>
      <h1>Tic Tac Toe Board!</h1>
    </nav>
    <main>
      <table>
        <tr class="row">
          <td id="0" onclick="play(0)"></td>
          <td id="1" onclick="play(1)"></td>
          <td id="2" onclick="play(2)"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="row">
          <td id="3" onclick="play(3)"></td>
          <td id="4" onclick="play(4)"></td>
          <td id="5" onclick="play(5)"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="row">
          <td id="6" onclick="play(6)"></td>
          <td id="7" onclick="play(7)"></td>
          <td id="8" onclick="play(8)"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <span>Player </span>
      <span id="player">X</span>
      <span>'s turn</span>
    </main>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```
</details>

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we will reassign value of the "player" from X to O when the board is clicked.

### Instructions
- In index.js, create a function called 'play'. This will be activated when any of the boxes are clicked. 
- In the play function, using 'getElementById', identify the span with the id of 'player'. set that equal to a variable. 
- Using that variable, reassign the content of that element to be 'O' if it is 'X', or vice-versa. 


### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> /index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const play = () => {
  const player = document.getElementById('player');

  if (player.innerText === 'X') {
    player.innerText = 'O';
  } else {
    player.innerText = 'X';
  }
};
```

</details>

## Step 3

### Summary

In this step, we will assign the player's value to the content of the square that is clicked.

### Instructions
- Open `index.js`
- Add a parameter to the function 'play'.
- Using the passed in parameter and 'getElementById', grab the information of the element clicked. Set that equal to a variable.
- Using that variable, assign the square that is clicked to have the value of the current player.
- For extra practice, add an edge case that will not let you reassign a square that has already been clicked!

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> /index.js </code> </summary>

```js
const play = (val) => {
  const player = document.getElementById('player');
  const element = document.getElementById(val);

  if (player.innerText === 'X') {
    player.innerText = 'O';
    element.innerText = 'X'
  } else {
    player.innerText = 'X';
    element.innerText = 'O'
  }
};
```

</details>

## Step 4

### Summary
In this step, we will create an arr that will keep track of the game's progress.

### Instructions
- Define an empty array to a variable at the top of `index.js`.
- In the play function, add the current player's value ('X' or 'O') to the defined array at the index of the square that was clicked. 
    - ex. If the first square was clicked by player 'X', we would expect 'X' to be added to the arr at index 0.
- Console.log the array in your function to keep track of it's current value.

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>/index.js</code> </summary>

```js
let board = []

const play = (val) => {
  const player = document.getElementById('player');
  const element = document.getElementById(val);

  if (player.innerText === 'X') {
    player.innerText = 'O';
    element.innerText = 'X'
    board[val] = 'X'
  } else {
    player.innerText = 'X';
    element.innerText = 'O'
    board[val] = 'O'
  }
  console.log(board)
};
```

</details>

## Step 5

### Summary

In this step, we will complete the logic that will determine if there is a winner, and alert that winner to the window.

### Instructions

- In the play function inside `index.js`, iterate over the array that you created in the previous step. 
- You will need to determine if there is a winner, and display the winning player to the screen using window.alert.
    - There are many different ways to accomplish this task. I encourage you to think through and write out each step that is needed as an outline.
- If there is no winner, alert the screen that CAT has won the game!

### Solution

<strong>Treat this as a toy problem. There are many solutions to finding a winner in Tic-Tac-Toe, so try your best to solve this on your own before looking at the solution below. </strong>

<details>
<summary><code>/index.js</code> </summary>

```js
let board = [];

const play = val => {
  const player = document.getElementById("player");
  const element = document.getElementById(val);

  if (player.innerText === "X") {
    player.innerText = "O";
    element.innerText = "X";
    board[val] = "X";
  } else {
    player.innerText = "X";
    element.innerText = "O";
    board[val] = "O";
  }

  let sq1 = board[0] // top row:  sq1 | sq2 | sq3
  let sq2 = board[1] //          -----------------
  let sq3 = board[2] // mid row   sq4 | sq5 | sq6
  let sq4 = board[3] //          -----------------
  let sq5 = board[4] // bot row   sq7 | sq8 | sq9
  let sq6 = board[5]
  let sq7 = board[6]
  let sq8 = board[7]
  let sq9 = board[8]

  //CHECKS ALL WINNING COMBINATIONS
  if (sq1 !== undefined && sq1 === sq2 && sq1 === sq3) {
    window.alert(`${sq1} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq4 !== undefined && sq4 === sq5 && sq4 === sq6) {
    window.alert(`${sq4} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq7 !== undefined && sq7 === sq8 && sq7 === board[8]) {
    window.alert(`${sq7} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq1 !== undefined && sq1 === sq4 && sq1 === sq7) {
    window.alert(`${sq1} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq2 !== undefined && sq2 === sq5 && sq2 === sq8) {
    window.alert(`${sq2} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq3 !== undefined && sq3 === sq6 && sq3 === board[8]) {
    window.alert(`${sq3} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq1 !== undefined && sq1 === sq5 && sq1 === board[8]) {
    window.alert(`${sq1} is the winner`);
    return
  } else if (sq7 !== undefined && sq7 === sq5 && sq7 === sq3) {
    window.alert(`${sq7} is the winner`);
    return
  }

  //DETERMINES IF THE BOARD IS FULL, ALERTS WHEN IT IS
  let boardFull = true
  for(let i = 0; i <= 8; i++){
    if(board[i] === undefined){
        boardFull = false
    }
  }
  if(boardFull === true){
    window.alert("Cat's game, there is no winner")
  }
};
```

</details>

## Black Diamond 

1. Create a function that resets the board after each game. This function should be called after the winner is revealed.
2. Add a button that resets the game when clicked. 
3. The current logic allows players to override a square that has already been played. Alter the function to remove the ability to override a square.
